# Quill-delta-rs 

This is a RUST implementation of the well-known `Quill Delta` library.
You can find the original JavaScript library at
[quill](https://github.com/quilljs/delta)

The functionality provided by this package is:
- Read `Delta` documents from string. Implemented as a feature,
- Edit the Delta document using operational transform commands,
- Write the `Delta` document to a `json`-formatted string.

The library provided is completely free of any formatting limitations.
So there are no checks that the attributes provided on a `Delta operation`
are actually valid.

Documentation:
 - User documentation: https://mundo-68.github.io/quill-delta-rs/delta/
 - Design documentation: [ ] todo ...

## Usage

```rust
fn main() {
    // create a delta and insert a string.
    let mut delta = Delta::default();
    delta.insert("Test");

    // create a link, and insert in to the delta document
    let mut attr = Attributes::default();
    attr.insert("src", "http://quilljs.com/image.png");
    delta.insert_attr( "link", attr);

    // Translate the delta document to a json string, and back.
    let json = serde_json::to_string(&delta).unwrap();
    let delta2: Delta = serde_json::from_str(&json).unwrap();
}


```
