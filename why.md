# Why did you write this crate?

I heard about `Rust` and decided to learn the language.
I also wanted a simple WIKI like program for use at home without requiring a large "LAMP" setup.
So I started a re-implementation of the quill editor.

This `Rust` crate should be interpreted as a compliment to the original implementation
which can be found on `github` as 
[quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/tree/main/packages/quill). All mistakes and inconveniences in `quill-rs` are my own.

As stated above; this is a learning experiment for me. Constructive comments, and contributions are welcome!
